# LearningOpenCV
This is my code(sjtu:5130379033) for Computer Vision homeworks.
###To Prof.Xiao and TAs: I'm 5130379033 from sjtu, and I'm not copying this code, for it is my works!

## Erode and Dilate
This is binary image processing, simply implements two methods(without OpenCV).

## Threshold
This is making a grey image into binary image, using Otsu and fuzzy set theories.
I make it possible to show 6 thresholds in one window.
Please put an image called "test.bmp" in the folder.

## Skeleton
This is also binary image processing, using thining and thickening(probably not used).
You can see it clearly that the image is changing.

## Other
I made a mistake about it! I was told to be cheating, they should look at the submit date.
I will submit other code right after the score is known.
